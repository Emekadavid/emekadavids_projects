# Emekadavid's Project Page

This repo is to serve as the central link for all the projects I will undertake on github.com. You can check it from time to time as I continue to do projects that interest me and that will benefit humanity. 

## Regression Projects

1. [Prediction of hourly bike rentals in Seoul, South Korea](https://github.com/Emekadavid/bike-rentals): Due to the dangers of climate change and global warming, many local authorities are incentivising sustainable modes of transportation like riding bicycles and using electric vehicles. This project provides a model that will help predict bike rental demand. The data set is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can find more details about the project by clicking the repo link above. 


## Classification Projects

1. [Mushroom classification](https://github.com/Emekadavid/mushroom-classification): Mushroom eating and hunting ("shrooming") has gained popularity in recent years. But the dangers are that mushrooms can be poisonous. This project provides a model that can be used to classify a specie of mushrooms as harmless or poisonous. I believe it will help mushroom lovers worldwide. 

## Data Analysis

1. [Tackling The Health Crises In Africa](https://github.com/Emekadavid/Data_analysis_competition): Africa is facing a health crises. One of them is medical tourism that takes away its essential financial resources. Also, it is facing a lot of brain drain of skilled medical personnel. A comprehensive exploration of the data from 10Alytics shows that more needs to be done to solve these problems. One of the recommendations is that African governments should prioritise health care.
