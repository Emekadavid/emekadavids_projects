# Emekadavid's Project Page

This repo is to serve as the central link for all the projects I will undertake on github.com. You can check it from time to time as I continue to do projects that interest me and that will benefit humanity. 

## Machine Learning 

### Regression Projects

1. [Prediction of hourly bike rentals in Seoul, South Korea](https://github.com/Emekadavid/bike-rentals): Due to the dangers of climate change and global warming, many local authorities are incentivising sustainable modes of transportation like riding bicycles and using electric vehicles. This project provides a model that will help predict bike rental demand. The data set is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can find more details about the project by clicking the repo link above. 


### Classification Projects

1. [Mushroom classification](https://github.com/Emekadavid/mushroom-classification): Mushroom eating and hunting ("shrooming") has gained popularity in recent years. But the dangers are that mushrooms can be poisonous. This project provides a model that can be used to classify a specie of mushrooms as harmless or poisonous. I believe it will help mushroom lovers worldwide. 

## Deep Learning

### Computer Vision 

1. [Kitchenware Classification](https://github.com/Emekadavid/kitchenware-classification): The kitchenware classification project was organized by Datatalks.Club on Kaggle. Participants have to classify 6 kitchen items, namely: cups, glasses, plates, spoons, forks, and knives. The model that was used for the project was tensorflow. It achieved a 96 percent accuracy rate on the classification task. 


## Data Analysis

1. [Analysis Of WeRateDogs Twitter Archive Data, 2017](https://github.com/Emekadavid/weratedogs_twitter_archive): Dogs are a beloved species that humans keep as pet. When I stumbled on a twitter archive for this dogs rating twitter page, I decided to do some data collection on other data and carry out an analysis of the twitter page. I found some interesting insights from the analysis. Check out the repo to find out.  

2. [Analysis of European Soccer, 2008-2016](https://github.com/Emekadavid/european_soccer): The World Cup will end this week on the 18th of December, 2022. Soccer lovers the world over are interested in several information about the game. This repository seeks to increase the knowledge of soccer lovers worldwide about European soccer. The analysis is constrained to the years 2008 to 2016 and involves the four major leagues in Europe. I hope you find the insights helpful and you can use them to enjoy this beautiful game. 

3. [Tackling The Health Crises In Africa](https://github.com/Emekadavid/Data_analysis_competition): Africa is facing a health crises. One of them is medical tourism that takes away its essential financial resources. Also, it is facing a lot of brain drain of skilled medical personnel. A comprehensive exploration of the data from 10Alytics shows that more needs to be done to solve these problems. One of the recommendations is that African governments should prioritise health care.
